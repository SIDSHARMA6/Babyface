create for me md file t i want real period tracker logic not just dummy like user open the period tracker then it shows today is 10th day ,with titles,ovulation,low pregancy,high pregancge,

Perfect — now you want your Profile Screen spec .md file to include a real, functional period tracker feature — not a dummy.

Let’s confirm what you want so I include real cycle logic (not static values).

Here’s what I’ll do in the .md file:

🩸 Period Tracker (Real Logic) — Core Rules (to be included)

We’ll implement a simple, medically correct ovulation and fertility prediction logic:

Cycle length: average 28 days (user can customize)

Period length: average 5 days

Ovulation day: cycle_start_date + 14 days

Fertile window: ovulation_day - 5 days → ovulation_day + 1 day

Low pregnancy probability: Days outside fertile window

High pregnancy probability: Days within fertile window

Next period prediction: cycle_start_date + cycle_length

Shows:

Current day in cycle (e.g. “Day 10 of 28”)

Current phase: Period / Follicular / Ovulation / Luteal

Fertility status (Low / High / Ovulation)

Countdown to next period

🧭 Real Flow

When user opens tracker:

User sets last period start date + average cycle length once.

Tracker automatically computes:

Today’s day in cycle

Ovulation and fertile days

Risk level

Next period due date

UI auto updates daily with background logic (Hive persistence).

If that matches what you need, I’ll include:

Full technical flow

Full logic formula + Riverpod state management

UI design layout (section card with colors, icons, titles)

Example data

Integration into Profile screen

Please confirm:
👉 Do you want me to include other sections too (bond info, memory, etc.) or only focus the .md file purely on the Period Tracker feature inside the profile?

Excellent — that’s a superb feature 💖 — you’re thinking like a real engagement designer.
You don’t want the period tracker to just show data — you want it to feel alive every single day with new dialogue or message from the app itself.

Let’s combine both ideas:

✅ Real 28-day biological cycle logic

💬 Daily emotional + personalized dialogues that change automatically based on the current day in the cycle

Here’s what your final period_tracker.md file will look like 👇
(complete, structured, and ready for Cursor IDE — no code, but full technical + logic + emotional design)

🧠 Real Logic (Cycle Calculation)

All values derived from:

User input:

last_period_start_date

cycle_length (default 28)

period_length (default 5)

Cycle math:

day_in_cycle = (today - last_period_start_date).inDays % cycle_length

ovulation_day = last_period_start_date + 14 days
fertile_start = ovulation_day - 5 days
fertile_end = ovulation_day + 1 day
next_period_start = last_period_start_date + cycle_length


Cycle Phases:

Phase	Day Range	Description
Menstrual	1-5	Period days
Follicular	6-13	Energy rises, mood bright
Ovulation	14	Peak fertility
Luteal	15-28	Calm, reflection, nesting
💬 Daily Dialogues — 28-Day Emotional + Biological Messages
