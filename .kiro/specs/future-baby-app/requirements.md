Refined Requirements Document – Future Baby App
Introduction

The Future Baby app is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows couples to upload individual photos and generate AI-powered predictions of their future child. The app combines emotional engagement with social features including quizzes, baby name generation, and result history. Built with Flutter, Firebase, and Hive, the app emphasizes lightweight, high-performance, ANR-free operations, offline support, and viral engagement. Monetization is achieved through freemium features, premium subscriptions, and social sharing incentives.

Requirements
Requirement 1 – Baby Face Generation

User Story: As a couple, I want to upload both photos and generate a baby face prediction to visualize our potential child and share it with friends.

Acceptance Criteria

Heavy processing (AI, image compression) runs in background isolates.

Thumbnail generation <1s; full-resolution generation <10s.

Async database operations to avoid UI blocking.

Network requests with timeouts, retries, and offline handling.

Friendly toasts for errors, not technical messages.

Automatic memory management and image caching.

Acceptance Criteria

Auto-save locally (Hive) and cloud (Firebase).

Store thumbnails, metadata, and generation date.

Full-resolution images encrypted in cloud storage.

History displayed in grid view with lazy loading.

WHEN I fail any question THEN I SHALL have the option to retry the level or get hints.

IF I complete a level THEN the system SHALL save my progress locally and sync to cloud when online.

WHEN difficulty increases THEN questions SHALL become more complex and puzzles SHALL require more steps.

WHEN I complete quizzes THEN I SHALL earn badges, points, and emotional feedback with couple avatars reacting.

WHEN I want to share results THEN I SHALL have one-tap sharing options with pre-filled captions.
