## Development Notes

### Critical Guidelines

- **ANR Prevention**: ALL heavy operations (image processing, AI calls, DB writes) MUST run in isolates
- **Performance First**: Target <1 second response time for all user interactions
- **Offline-First**: Local Hive storage with Firebase sync, app works without internet
- **Responsive Design**: Test on multiple screen sizes, orientations, and devices
- **Minimal Code**: Write the absolute minimum code needed, avoid verbose implementations
- **Loose Coupling**: Use dependency injection, avoid tight coupling between components
- **Baby Theme**: Maintain cute, playful aesthetics throughout with baby fonts and colors

### Development Sequence

1. **Foundation First** (Tasks 1-4): Setup, models, image processing, UI components
2. **Core Workflow** (Tasks 5-6): Dashboard and baby generation - the heart of the app
