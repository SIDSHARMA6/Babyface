# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the standardization of theme, typography, colors, and responsiveness across the BabyFace Flutter application. The goal is to eliminate hardcoded colors and text styles, ensure consistent theming with proper light/dark mode support, implement universal responsiveness, and fix existing test issues. This will create a maintainable, consistent user interface that follows Flutter best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theme system, so that I can maintain consistent colors and styling across the entire application without hardcoded values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load a unified theme configuration that defines all colors, gradients, and visual properties
2. WHEN any component needs styling THEN it SHALL use theme properties instead of hardcoded Color values
3. WHEN the theme is updated THEN all components SHALL automatically reflect the new styling without individual component changes
4. IF a component uses hardcoded colors THEN the system SHALL be refactored to use theme properties
5. WHEN light or dark mode is toggled THEN all components SHALL automatically adapt using the appropriate theme variant

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized typography system using Handscup fonts, so that text styling is consistent and maintainable throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders text THEN it SHALL use predefined text styles from a centralized typography system
2. WHEN Handscup fonts are applied THEN they SHALL be properly configured in the theme system
3. WHEN any component needs text styling THEN it SHALL use theme text styles instead of hardcoded TextStyle properties
4. IF a component uses hardcoded text properties THEN it SHALL be refactored to use theme text styles
5. WHEN text styles need modification THEN changes SHALL be made only in the centralized typography configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a universal responsiveness system, so that all components adapt properly to different screen sizes without individual responsive implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on different screen sizes THEN all components SHALL scale appropriately using a unified responsive system
2. WHEN responsive values are needed THEN components SHALL use centralized responsive utilities instead of hardcoded dimensions
3. WHEN screen orientation changes THEN all components SHALL maintain proper proportions and usability
4. IF a component uses hardcoded dimensions THEN it SHALL be refactored to use responsive utilities
5. WHEN new components are created THEN they SHALL automatically inherit responsive behavior from the centralized system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want universal bouncing scroll behavior, so that all scrollable areas have consistent physics and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any scrollable widget is used THEN it SHALL implement consistent bouncing scroll physics
2. WHEN the application runs on different platforms THEN scroll behavior SHALL remain consistent across iOS and Android
3. WHEN custom scroll widgets are created THEN they SHALL inherit the universal scroll configuration
4. IF existing scroll widgets lack proper physics THEN they SHALL be updated to use the universal scroll system
5. WHEN scroll behavior needs modification THEN changes SHALL be made in a centralized scroll configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all widget tests to pass reliably, so that the testing suite validates component functionality without false failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ResponsiveButton tests are executed THEN they SHALL pass without tap target warnings or failures
2. WHEN widget tests run THEN they SHALL properly interact with themed components
3. WHEN test widgets are created THEN they SHALL use proper theme and responsive configurations
4. IF test failures occur due to theming issues THEN the test setup SHALL be corrected to work with the standardized theme system
5. WHEN new tests are written THEN they SHALL follow the established testing patterns for themed components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual appearance across all screens, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between screens THEN all visual elements SHALL maintain consistent styling and spacing
2. WHEN the same component type appears in different contexts THEN it SHALL have identical appearance and behavior
3. WHEN interactive elements are used THEN they SHALL provide consistent feedback and visual states
4. IF visual inconsistencies exist THEN they SHALL be resolved through the standardized theme system
5. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN all themed components SHALL maintain proper contrast and readability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to support both light and dark themes seamlessly, so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I toggle between light and dark mode THEN all components SHALL immediately reflect the appropriate theme colors
2. WHEN using dark mode THEN text SHALL remain readable with proper contrast ratios
3. WHEN using light mode THEN all visual elements SHALL be clearly visible and accessible
4. IF any component doesn't adapt to theme changes THEN it SHALL be updated to use proper theme properties
5. WHEN the system theme changes THEN the application SHALL automatically follow the system preference if configured to do so
