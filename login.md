# 💕 BabyFace Login Screen Specification (Final - No Lottie / No Sound)

## 🌸 Overview
This login screen is the first emotional touchpoint of the BabyFace app.  
It should immediately feel **cute, warm, loving, and romantic** — like a gentle invitation to enter a world of connection and happiness.

No Lottie, no sound — only Flutter-native animations, soft gradients, and emoji-based charm.  
Everything must be **ultra-responsive**, **theme-compliant**, and **ANR-free**.
